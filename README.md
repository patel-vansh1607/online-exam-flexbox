 - it contains a prfile pic, name, skills
 - and a button that they can be reached out on email

FLEX BOX PROPERTIES USED

1. display: flex - used in  .maindiv container 

2. flex-direction: column - ensure the cards stay in the colum order and if screen is changed they go to row

3. gap - adjusting size between divs

4. align-items: center - centre the cards in the screen

5. width and margin-top - control size of cards
